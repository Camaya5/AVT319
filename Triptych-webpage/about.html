    <h2>About</h2>
    <br>
    <h2><span>I did not create this! Well, not exactly.</span></h2>
    <p> <span>Trinity of Time</span> came to life with the intention of opening a conversation about religion. I started
      with the question: "Did the Renaissance influence society's view of Christianity? I then researched and found
      blogs about how churches did not have to close because of the use of technology (Memory, 2021), and articles about
      how it could be fulfilling prophecies foretold in the Bible (Palm, 2019). With prophecies being consistent in my
      research, I watched a 2-part video by the YouTube channel The Bible Project titled "Book of Revelation Summary: A
      Complete Animated Overview". I also wanted to conduct my own research, so I created a survey that I sent out to
      George Mason students with simple questions about being a Christian and willingness to join an online church
      service, among others. This is a key that opens the door to a deeper issue that can further be explored in the
      future.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I created a triptych in collaboration with artificial intelligence because I wanted to show the comparison of
      Christianity at three points in time: The Renaissance, current day, and the future. I came across Canva's new
      "Magic Media" feature, where the user types prompts and chooses from four different versions the web application
      creates. While it took some refining, I came up with the following prompts for each one in order:
      <br>
      <li><span>The inside of a cathedral in the style of the renaissance with a background of Italy.</span></li>
      <br>
      <li><span>A virtual reality image of the inside of a cathedral in modern 2023 style.</span></li>
      <br>
      <li><span>A new Jerusalem, where human cultures and all their diversity work together in peace and harmony before
          God. There's no temple building because the presence of God and the Lamb that were once limited to the temple
          now permeate every square inch of the new world.</span></li>
      <br>
      Moreover, I implemented Adobe Photoshop's Generative Fill in parts of the compositions by adding benches, priests,
      people, a screen, a preacher, fog, and a galaxy. I used the Renaissance as reference for the first triptych, and
      after seeing virtual reality games like VR Chat, I opted to create a prompt that encompassed a virtual reality
      experience for the second composition.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>To highlight Christianity, I used cathedrals for the first two settings because a big part of the Renaissance is
      architecture, and the inside of a cathedral further reenforces the Christian aspect of the piece. The first two
      pieces contain aspects of their time that trace back to Christianity, many of which I added in Photoshop.</p>
    <br>
    <p>For the third composition, I had no idea. I considered leaving it empty, but I decided to test the limits of ai.
      While the future is unknown, what ai can interpret can be one of the possibilities the future can be. No one knows
      the future, so I strongly referenced the animated summary of the book of Revelation. One big part of Christianity
      is heaven (John 3:16). Jesus points out that He will return, but not even He knows when it would happen; only God
      knows the time when that will happen. To simplify, God, in the book of Revelation, will destroy all evil and
      create a new city where, according to the summary of the book of Revelation, be <span>"a new Jerusalem, where
        human cultures and all their diversity work together in peace and harmony before God. There's no temple building
        because the presence of God and the Lamb that were once limited to the temple now permeate every square inch of
        the new world" </span>(BibleProject, 10:24 - 10:42). No one knows when it will happen, except God. I used a
      dreamy style for the third composition as a possibility of how the future may unfold (a prediction, if you may).
