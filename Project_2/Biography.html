            <p>Chris is a creative that started as a curious kid at the age of 13. As a church volunteer, Chris acquired
                knowledge in various fields of the creative industry, a few being graphic design, photoraphy, social
                media management, among others. He is studyiing graphic design at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia
                to increase his mastery in graphic art. His work has been seen on social media and his works have been
                featured in art magazines. The spark of light in his work is his faith, and the stories in his works are felt.
                His photographs are crafted delicately in an aim to capture the precious moments in life and their
                beauty.</p>

                One of Chris' goals is to tell his story through his work. More specifically, his journey as a Christian.
                Using a combination of digital composites, photographs, and abstraction, together and seperate, he wants
                his visuals to serve as a mirror of his faith journey as he grows in his relationship with God. He will
                be with us to showcase and also open conversation in regards to the world of storytelling and how
                artists can combine the two. Moreover, Chris will share his struggles in the early stages of his career
                as a creative and how he did not see his faith jorney as a separate life, but rather used it as the subject of his
                works, creating genuine, sincere works that spark interest in the curious minds.</p>
