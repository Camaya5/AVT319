        <p>We aim to create an enviroment where creatives from all aspects of life, cultures, perspectives, stories and
            beliefs can feel comfortable and welcomed to share their stories with others.
            <br>
            <br>
            Each year, our conferences feature a variety of artists that you may know of and some that you may not.
            Every artist has a spot in our space, and we want to give back to them by giving them a place where they
            can tell their stories. Since the beginning, it has never been about us, but about artists gathering
            together to learn from each other. Some of our speakers work in the fields of design, filmmaking, poetry,
            engineering, developing, and more.
            <br>
            <br>
            The topics for our conferences are derived from spaces that we create where like-minded individuals can
            gather and learn. This year, our yearly conference is focusing on being a Christian artist and how our
            speakers have navigated the field while staying true to their beliefs.
