<p>One of their most beloved features, Huskies are known for their distinctive-looking almond-shaped eyes, which can be seen in a variety of colors. They are most commonly seen with either ice blue eyes or deep brown eyes, but sometimes even this varies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Huskies have one eye of each color (bi-eyed), or more rarely, eyes that have a mixture of both blue and brown in them (known as parti-colored). While there are other dog breeds that also have a multi-hued range of eye colors (like Border Collies and Australian Shepherds), Huskies are most commonly known for this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Both blue and brown eyes are normal for Huskies and rarely represent any eye problems or illnesses.</p>
