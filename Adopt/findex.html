    <p>This is Luke. He has been like a little brother to us since he was born. He would hang with us during breakfast, eat with us during lunch, and go for runs and walks in the afternoon before enjoying a warm chimney session before having dinner and heading off to bed. He has become a companion and a close friend, and we know he would love to have a new home, a new family, and have some new friends. Luke loves children and enjoys playing ball with kids and going for jogs. Don't let the size fool you; Luke has the strength of a mature German Shepherd in the size of a young dogoo. Like Luke, there are many more huskies who are waiting for family, a home, and a cozy fire to lay next to after a long day outside.These White-fur, blue eyed friends are amazing species that manage the cold, have the strength and also the cuteness of a dog; it is a little bit of everything in one small friend. Like the image above, they are waiting for a friend, and that friend can be you. Get to know them and consider giving this doggo a home.
